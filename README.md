Random Stuff that's never finished

* FeihtWorx.Data - ORM that does things in ways that only make sense to me.

This is one of those things that I started as a pet project, but never I had the time to finish it after hours, so it's many years of messy interrupted code, and tool changes, and coding style changes, and unit test framework changes, and overall need changes.

As far as I can tell I started this code somewhere in 2010. This is a rewrite from scratch of another project that is a rewrite from scratch that is based on another idea.

There are lots of better tools out there. Don't use this. It's only in GitHub because it makes it easier for me to tinker with it when I get 5 minutes of spare time.

It started out in an early version of Sharp Develop because at the time I was fascinated with code-coverage and Sharp Develop had that built in for unit test for free.
